## The Sociocracy 3.0 Movement

The Sociocracy 3.0 Movement seeks to make Sociocracy 3.0 available and applicable to as many organizations as possible and provides resources under a [Creative Commons Free Culture License](/license/) for people who want to learn, apply and tell others about Sociocracy 3.0.

The movement is stewarded by a distributed network of pioneering consultants, coaches and learning facilitators from a variety of fields, who share a deep appreciation for the transformational potential of Sociocracy 3.0 to help organizations and their members thrive, and dedicate some of their time to experimenting with, and more or less directly contributing towards the development and evolution of Sociocracy 3.0
