# Invitation to translating Sociocracy 3.0 Resources #

First of all, thank you for the numerous offers for helping with translations of the Sociocracy 3.0 resources. We feel that the introduction presentation has now matured to a degree we are comfortable with inviting you all for translating it. 

[Crowdin](http://crowdin.com) kindly supports the Sociocracy 3.0 Movement by providing free access to their excellent online translation tool. It's designed to make collaboration on translations to many different languages as effortless as possible.

To contribute to translations, you can [log in to Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/login) using your Facebook, google, twitter or github account, or [create a free account on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/join).

After [logging in](https://crowdin.com/login), you can add translations to the [Sociocracy 3.0 project](https://crowdin.com/project/sociocracy-30):

Simply click on a flag to start adding translations for that language. This will take you to the list of documents.

 If your language is not present in the list, [contact us](http://sociocracy30.org/contact/) and we will add the language for you.

## Using Crowdin for Translations ##

Crowding has a [quick start manual available](https://crowdin.com/page/quick-start), and we also have compiled a short introduction to get you started:

After selecting a language, you will see a list of documents waiting for translation:

Pick a document and start, it's easy.

It's a good idea to use the guided tour, by clicking on ![](http://sociocracy30.org/static-images/translations/help.png) (in the upper right of the screen). The tour is very short but explains everything you need to know

You may want to take a look at the keyboard shortcuts by clicking on ![](http://sociocracy30.org/static-images/translations/shortcuts.png)  (in the upper right of the screen). They will help you translate a lot faster because you don't need to reach for your mouse to move forward to the next piece of text.

When you enter Crowdin for the first time, the English source text is presented in the left column in the so called  "WYSIWYG"[^for "What You See Is What You Get"] mode. You can activate "highlight untranslated sections" by clicking on ![](http://sociocracy30.org/static-images/translations/highlight.png) (above the left column).

There is also another mode called "list mode", activated by clicking on ![](http://sociocracy30.org/static-images/translations/mode.png) (above the left column). If you prefer the list mode, you can change it to display the full text of each section: Click on ![](http://sociocracy30.org/static-images/translations/settings.png) (in the upper right of the screen), then activate "*Show the whole string*" in the section" *View of Source Strings List*".

## Best Practices for Translations ##

Before you start translating documents,  please **make sure the glossary is translated first**, and find the correct terms in your language. Contact us if you have any doubts and we will try to help as best we can.

When translating documents, please make sure to  **provide an identical translation for each occurrence of a term from the glossary**. Be especially careful when translating value and values, as they might have two different translations in your language.

If a phrase is already in the translation memory, consider using that instead of creating a different translation.

If something seems hard to translate, **sometimes it's a good idea to skip that text until later**, progressing through the document will give you a clearer picture, and it's easy to find and fill in the missing translations later.

Please **DO NOT translate text inside curly brackets** (e.g.  {{policy-life-cycle.md}}). these are file names and need to remain as they are.

Also, please **DO NOT translate anything marked as "hidden texts"** (like "inline, fit"), this is used for positioning and sizing images.
